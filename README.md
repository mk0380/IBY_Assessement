Step 1: Open your VS code select the folder where you want to run the code and run this command in terminal : git clone https://github.com/mk0380/IBY_Assessement

Step 2: Run command:cd IBY_Assessment

Step 3: Run command: npm i

Strp 4: Run command: npm start

        Now the backend whould have started and you would be getting message that server had started on port 5000

Step 5: now open a new terminal and now run command: cd IBY_Assessment
                                                       cd ./frontend
                                                       npm i --force
                                                       npm start

Step 6: after running "npm start" the react will start and if some error ocuurs like "ssl error" then run command "npm install node --reinstall-packages-from=node" and then run command "npm start". Now the frontend part would defenitely start.
